# Natural Language Optimization

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the development and exploration of text-based optimization techniques. It focuses on applying various algorithms to solve non-convex non-linear optimization problems in the domain of natural language processing.

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to compare the performance of different optimization algorithms when applied to text. These algorithms attempt to find optimal solutions under specific constraints using a defined loss function, with a particular focus on scenarios where the solution space is large and not well-defined.

## Problem Formulation

The framework uses:
- A **Loss Function** `L: S -> R`, where `S` is a string and `R` represents real numbers. This function evaluates the cost associated with any given string in the space `S`.
- A **Constraint Function** `C: S -> B`, where `B` is a set of Boolean values (True or False). This function determines whether a given string meets certain criteria.

The optimization task involves finding a string `s` in `S` that minimizes `L(s)` while ensuring `C(s) = True`.

## Methodology

The repository explores different algorithms for non-convex non-linear optimization in natural language settings. These methods typically involve:
- Sampling to estimate local approximations of convex problems .
- Solving these approximations to find local minima.
- Using stochastic elements (such as the temperature parameter) to prevent premature convergence local minima near the startin point.
- Iteratively repeating the process around the new local minimum.

The techniques implemented in this repository are designed to handle the challenges associated with the high-dimensional and discrete nature of text data.

## Applications

The methods developed here can be applied to various NLP tasks that require optimization, such as generating text that meets specific criteria, optimizing marketing copy, or developing new literary styles within given constraints.

## Conclusion

By providing a platform for experimentation and comparison, this repository aims to advance the field of text-based optimization and contribute to the understanding of how non-linear and non-convex optimization methods can be effectively applied in natural language processing.
